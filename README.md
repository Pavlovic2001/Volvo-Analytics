# Volvo-Analytics

Project Description

In this project, I showcased my ability to collect, process, and visualize data by creating a complete report in Power BI.
I began by scraping data from Volvo Car AB (publ.)'s Annual and Sustainability Report 2024, followed by cleaning and structuring the data in Excel to ensure high quality and consistency.
Next, I built relational tables and modeled the data using SQL in a PostgreSQL database, setting up data pipelines to streamline further processing.
Once prepared, the data was loaded into Power BI, where I had already formulated key questions that the report aimed to answer.
To support this, I wrote advanced SQL queries in PostgreSQL to extract, combine, and prepare the necessary data for analysis.
Finally, I designed and developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI, visualizing insights and findings based on the processed data.

The goal of the project was to demonstrate the complete workflow from data collection to the final report and to highlight my skills in data handling, SQL development, data modeling, and data visualization.
